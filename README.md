### Some Insights into the Data (SQL)

Among countries with the highest number of suicides on average, Greenland is number one with an incredibly high 78 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Greenland again, has the highest number of depressive disorders from any country in the world on average. It also has an extremely high percentage of mental health disorders for females, far more than the second highest country. For males, its still the highest but not by much, unlike the female prevalence. 

Drug, Alcohol and Substance abuse disorders are also interesting. Surprisingly, the USA has the highest number of drug related mental health disorders. Eastern Europe on the other hand (countries such Russia, Belarus, Estonia, Ukraine, etc.) has the highest number of alcohol related mental health disorders, with the top 10 countries being almost filled completely with Eastern European countries.

### Interactive Dashboards (Tableau)

These are the two interactive dashboards that were created in Tableau. The map lists all 7 mental health disorders with a slider bar for the year to see the change in that specific disease over the years. The scatterplot demonstrates the relationship between the prevalence of male and female disorders. The dots represent countries, and there is a slider for the years. Hovering over the drops will give more info on the specific country and  that specific year. Countries can also be searched for.  
**NOTE**: These are only screenshot previews of the dashboards, as they cannot be posted on github. The dashboard is availble in the above file.
